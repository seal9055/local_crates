# local_crates

This repository has some crates I frequently use for other projects that do not have official 
crates. These may be my own crates or other crates I stumbled across and used in some of my projects

Current Projects:

elfparser: A very simple elf parser who's sole purpose is to extract the elf_hdr and the program headers  

dll-injector: Library that can be used to inject dll's into exe's
